# Hi, I'm Holly Nava

**UX Designer | Product Strategist | Aspiring Code Pretender**

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where a designer tries to convince the internet she knows how to code.

## About Me

I spend my days crafting user experiences and product strategies. I spend my nights asking Claude to explain what a "dependency" is for the fifth time.

- By day: Pushing pixels, mapping user journeys, making things functional and beautiful
- By night: Pushing code (with a lot of help), breaking things, googling error messages
- Full-time: Pretending I understand what I'm doing

## The Truth

```
Actual skills:        UX Design | Product Strategy | User Research | Figma
Skills I'm faking:    Everything in this GitHub profile
Secret weapon:        Claude (doing the heavy lifting since 2024)
```

## What's Happening Here

Most of these repos were made possible by:
- 10% me having an idea
- 10% me typing commands I half-understand
- 80% Claude patiently explaining things and writing the actual code

## My Development Philosophy

1. If it works, don't touch it
2. If it breaks, ask Claude
3. `git push` and pray

## Let's Connect

If you're also a designer/PM/non-engineer trying to learn this stuff, let's be confused together.

*"I don't always understand my code, but when I do, it's because Claude wrote really good comments."*
